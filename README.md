# AngularD3Showcase
###This is an AngularJS application that showcases a variety of techniques and patterns, including:
 * Integrating D3 with Angular
 * Creating D3 components using TDD
 * Creating reusable charts using the Revealing Module pattern and a little functional programming
 * Mocking with sinon.js
 * Dispatching custom events from D3 components
 * Wrapping D3 components in Angular Directives
 * Injecting mock services into Directives
 * Nesting directives with transclusion
 * Testing event handlers
 * Inter-Directive communication using events and shared scope (a basic Mediator pattern)
 * and more
 
## Getting Started
Assuming you have npm, bower, and grunt installed, the following commands should get you up and running:

```
npm install
bower install
grunt serve
```
At that point, you should see something like this in your browser:

To run the tests using PhantomJS...

```
grunt test
```

## Reusable Grouped Bar Chart component
I wanted to create a reusable D3 grouped bar chart and wrap it in a service so I could inject that service into a custom directive. 
I could have chosen to use d3 directly from a directive, but injecting a service allows me to mock that service when I test my directive.

I developed my D3Service using TDD. The spec is here:

[d3ServiceSpec.js](https://github.com/tombray/angular-d3-showcase/blob/master/test/spec/services/d3ServiceSpec.js)

and the service is here:

[d3Service.js](https://github.com/tombray/angular-d3-showcase/blob/master/app/scripts/services/d3service.js)

I wanted users of the chart to be able to pass in their own functions for some of the logic that the chart needs to perform on their data. Here is a 
snippet showing the setters on the reusable chart module:

'''
exports.yValueFunction = function(f) {
    if (!arguments.length) { return yValue; }
    yValue = f;
    return this;
};

exports.yMaxFunction = function(f) {
    if (!arguments.length) { return yMax; }
    yMax = f;
    return this;
};
'''
